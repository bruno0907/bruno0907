### Hello!!! ðŸ‘‹



My name is Bruno and im a Computer Tech professional working my way to become a FullStack Dev. 

About me:
2 years ago i got burned out of my profession and decided to give it up and search for a new carreer path. Tried a few things here and there and i must admit i dont remember how but i strumbled on JS, React and React Native and all that comes with and my passion for web techs that a mix of bad teachers, bad computer science school, html table/float web design, ASP/IIS early days of terror made me drop the webdev world back in the day. 

Nowadays:
Today, i'm currenctly learning Node, ReactJS and React Native and loving it! HTML5 and CSS3 brought me back to this amazing world. I'm making use of all the public material put out with care, love and effort by the community with special thanks to Rocketseat, Cod3r, Alura, Devsoutinho, B7Web, Matheus Silva and many others. So much material. 

The Future:
- Dont stop learning. For too long I lost my interesting in learning and payd the toll. But everyone has its own timing and must respect it.
- Put my learning efforts in pratice.
- Work work work. 
- Become a better version of me everyday.

Hobbies:
Music, Gym, Sleep, Do nothing... (very important)
